## 🚀 Features

- **Spreadsheet-style Table UI**:  
  View and edit data in an intuitive, Excel-like grid format.

- **Sorting by Columns**:  
  Click on any column header to toggle between ascending/descending sorting. Visual indicators highlight the current sort direction.

- **Column Resizing**:  
  Resize columns by dragging the edge of the column header. Minimum widths are enforced to maintain readability.

- **Row Highlighting on Hover**:  
  As you hover over a row, it is highlighted to make tracking data across wide tables easier.

- **Sticky Table Header**:  
  The table header remains visible as you scroll.

- **Editable Cells**:  
  Double-click (or press Enter) on editable cells (e.g., Name, Email, Role) to modify their values inline.

- **Column Visibility Toggling**:  
  Dynamically toggle visibility of columns via the 'Columns' dropdown.
